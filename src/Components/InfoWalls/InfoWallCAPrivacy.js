                 third parties, subject to your right to opt out of those sales (see Exercise Your Right to Opt-out below). The CCPA
                  defines “sell” broadly to include many different types of data disclosures or data sharing to third parties for

                   with select third parties, we do not sell your data to third parties in the traditional sense of the word, including
                    collecting, compiling and then selling your data to data brokers, data resellers or other similar parties.

                <h2>A Special Note on Loyalty Programs</h2>
                <p>
                From time to time, we may offer financial incentives or “price or service differences” in exchange 
                for your personal information to the extent that doing so is reasonably related to the value of the 
                personal information that we collect in a manner consistent with the non-discrimination requirements 
                of the CCPA. Specifically, in order to participate in certain of our loyalty or rewards program(s) 
                (e.g., through our Ultimate kiosks), you may be asked to provide personal information in exchange
                 for cash, reward points, or other financial incentive, or price or service difference, the amount or
                  nature of which will be specified in each instance at the time the personal information is to be 
                  submitted. You can opt into the financial incentive or price or service difference by submitting your
                   personal information. If you wish to opt-out of the financial incentive or price or service difference,
                    do not submit your personal information or, if you previously submitted your personal information to
                     an ongoing loyalty or rewards program, please email privacy@Bon Appetit Delivery.com to opt-out with the subject 
                     line “Loyalty Opt-Out.”
                </p>
                <p>
                Each financial incentive or price or service difference related to submission and use of personal information
                 is based upon our reasonable but sole determination of the estimated value of such information, which takes 
                 into consideration, without limitation, estimates regarding the anticipated revenue generated from such information,
                  the anticipated expenses which might be incurred in the collection, storage, and use of such information in the
                   operation of our business, and other relevant factors related to the estimated value of such information to our 
                   business, as permitted under the CCPA.

                   <h3>Exercise Your Right to Know or Right to Delete</h3>    
                   <p>
                   You may submit a request to exercise your California Privacy Rights through one of the mechanisms 
                   described below. We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may 
                   require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account.
                    We will only use personal information provided in connection with a California Privacy Rights request 
                    to review and comply with your request. You may also designate an authorized agent to make requests on 
                    your behalf. In order to be able to act, authorized agents must submit a request using the email address 
                    below and provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the requestor is an authorized agent with written
                     permission to act on your behalf.                       
                   </p>   
                   <p>
                   In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the Right to Know or Right to Delete 
                   described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity. If we are unable to comply
                    with all or a portion of your request, we will explain the reasons for declining to comply with the request.    
                   </p>

                 <h3>Exercise Your Right to Opt-out</h3>
                 <p>
                 Unless you have exercised your Right to Opt-out, we may disclose or “sell” your personal information 
                 to third parties for monetary or other valuable consideration. The third parties to whom we sell personal
                  information may use such information for their own purposes in accordance with their own privacy policies.
                   Remember, CCPA defines data “sales” broadly. While Bon Appetit Delivery may disclose or otherwise share your personal
                    information with select third parties, we do not sell your data to third parties in the traditional sense
                     of the word, including collecting, compiling and then selling your data to data brokers, data resellers or
                      other similar parties.
                 </p>
                 <p>To exercise the Right to Opt-out of personal information sales, you may submit a request below:</p>
                 <ul style={{padding:"0 2rem"}}>
                     <li>
                     For Bon Appetit Delivery, click <a target="_blank"  rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.Bon Appetit Deliverydelivery.com">here</a>.
                     </li>                   
                 </ul>
                 <p>
                 You do not need to create an account with us to exercise your Right to Opt-out. However,
                  we may ask you to provide additional personal information so that we can properly identify
                   you to track compliance with your opt-out request. We will only use personal information
                    provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request. If you choose not
                     to provide this information, we may only be able to process your request to the extent
                      we are able to identify you in our data systems.
                 </p>
                 <p>Once you make an opt-out request, <i>you may not opt back in to personal information sales.</i></p>
                 <p>
                 <strong>Minors.</strong> We do not sell the personal information of consumers we know to be less than 16 years of age,
                  unless we receive affirmative authorization (the "Right to Opt In") from either the minor who is between
                   13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a minor less than 13 years of age. Please contact
                    us at privacy@Bon Appetit Delivery.com to inform us if you, or your minor child, are under the age of 16. If you are
                     a California resident under the age of 18 and want to remove your personal information from our 
                     publicly-displayed content, you can contact us directly at privacy@Bon Appetit Delivery.com; however, we may not
                      be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances.
