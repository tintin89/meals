            <h2>ABOUT Bon Appetit Delivery</h2>
            <p>
            Bon Appetit Delivery is a virtual marketplace Platform that connects hungry diners with third-party service providers, including local restaurants
             and independent delivery service providers. You may order food through the Platform to be delivered from particular restaurants, 
             including their authorized licensees and franchisees, or other purveyors of food in cities throughout the United States and other 
             territories where Bon Appetit Delivery provides such Services (collectively, the “Restaurants”).
            </p>
            <p>
            Bon Appetit Delivery is not a restaurant or food preparation entity. The Restaurants available on our Platform operate independently of Bon Appetit Delivery.
             Restaurants are required to comply with federal, state, and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to the preparation,
              sale, and marketing of food, including, without limitation, food preparation and safety and menu disclosure. Bon Appetit Delivery is not liable or 
              responsible for Restaurants' food preparation or safety and does not verify their compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, Bon Appetit Delivery
               does not guarantee the quality of what the Restaurants sell, nor does it guarantee the services provided by them, including, without
                limitation, in those cases where they provide the delivery services or engage another third-party delivery service. Bon Appetit Delivery does 
                 independently verify, and is not liable for, representations made by Restaurants regarding their food, including, without limitation,
                  any menu- or Restaurant-level descriptors, disclosures, photographs or images displayed through the Platform reflecting the food 
                  prepared by the Restaurants and/or delivered by Delivery Partners (defined below).
            </p>
            <p>
            Bon Appetit Delivery is not a delivery company or a common carrier. Some deliveries are provided by Bon Appetit Delivery's network of independent delivery 
            service providers (“Delivery Partners”). Delivery Partners have entered into agreements with Bon Appetit Delivery which require them to comply 
            with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation, traffic laws, requirements
             of the applicable motor vehicle agency, and applicable insurance requirements. By accessing the Platform, you agree and acknowledge
              that Delivery Partners are solely responsible for, and Bon Appetit Delivery shall not be liable or responsible for, the delivery services provided
               to you by any Delivery Partner or any subcontractors of Delivery Partners, or any acts, omissions, errors or misrepresentations 
               made by any Delivery Partner.
            </p>
            <h2>USING BON APPETIT DELIVERY</h2>
            <p>
            You may only create and hold one account on each of the separately branded properties on the Platforms (each, an “Account”) for your
             personal use. You may have another Account if you are using the Platform for business purposes, including as part of an enterprise
              Account, pursuant to a separate agreement with Bon Appetit Delivery. In consideration of the use of the Platform and the Services, you agree that 
              you are able to create a binding legal obligation with Bon Appetit Delivery, and you also agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current, and 
              complete information about yourself, and (b) maintain and promptly update the personal information you provide to keep it true,
               accurate, current, and complete.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Platform may permit you to use the Services without an Account or without logging in to your Account (e.g. on our in-store kiosks
             or as a guest with our group order feature). If you use the Service in this manner, we may create an Account for you based on the
              information you provide to us in connection with the transaction (e.g., your payment information, name, phone number, email address,
               and other transaction information). If you are a minor in the jurisdiction in which you reside (generally under the age of 18),
                you must have the permission of, and be directly supervised by, your parent or legal guardian to use the Platform, and your parent
                 or legal guardian must read and agree to this Agreement prior to your using the Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are 
                 not authorized to use the Platform or otherwise access the Services if you are under the age of 13. If you are using the Platform 
                 on behalf of an entity, organization, or company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization 
                 to this Agreement and you agree to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of that entity, organization, or company. If you provide 
                 any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, including, without limitation, having an invalid or expired 
                 payment method on file, or if Bon Appetit Delivery has reasonable grounds to suspect that any information you provide is untrue, inaccurate, not
                  current or incomplete, Bon Appetit Delivery has the right to block your current or future use of the Platform and/or the Services (or any portion
                   thereof) and/or terminate this Agreement with you. If your Account is terminated for any or no reason, you may forfeit any pending,
                    current, or future account credits, Perks (defined below) or other promotional offers, and any other forms of unredeemed value in or
                     associated with your Account without prior notice to you.
              </p>
              <p>
              You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account including your password and, if applicable, any 
              password for Facebook, Google, or other third party login. You are also responsible for all activities or any other actions that occur
              under or that are taken in connection with your Account. You agree to: (a) immediately notify Bon Appetit Delivery of any known or suspected
              unauthorized use(s) of your password or Account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including, without limitation, loss,
              theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information; and (b) ensure that you exit from your Account at
              the end of each session. Grubhub will not be liable for any injury, loss, or damage of any kind arising from or relating to your 
             failure to comply with (a) and/or (b) or for any acts or omissions by you or someone else who is using your Account and/or password.
              </p>
              <h2>OUR ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES POLICY</h2>
              <p>
              Some jurisdictions permit the ordering and delivery of alcoholic beverages. In such jurisdictions, if you place an order that includes
               any alcoholic beverage, you represent and warrant that you are at least 21 years of age. Upon delivery or pickup, as applicable, you
                shall present a government-issued identification card, evidencing your age, consistent with applicable legal requirements. 
                The Delivery Partner may electronically scan the identification card of the individual receiving the order to confirm that the 
                recipient is at least 21 years of age and the delivery may be completed. You also agree that our Delivery Partners may withhold 
                delivery of the alcoholic beverages if you appear or the recipient of the delivery appears intoxicated when receiving delivery of 
                such products. If you do not comply with these terms, you agree that the alcoholic beverage(s) will not be released to you, you may
                 forfeit the cost of such beverages, and you may be responsible for restocking fees.
              </p>
              <h2>PAYMENT AND OUR CREDIT POLICY</h2>
              <p>
              Certain features of the Platform, including, without limitation, the placing or receipt of orders, may require you to make certain
               payments, including commissions or other fees. When paid by you, these payments are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise 
               determined by Bon Appetit Delivery. Bon Appetit Delivery, in its sole discretion, may offer credits or refunds on a case-by-case basis including, by way of
                example, in the event of an error with your order or in the amounts you were charged.
              </p>
              <p>
              Bon Appetit Delivery will charge, and you authorize Bon Appetit Delivery to charge, the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. If you pay any
               amounts with a credit card, Bon Appetit Delivery may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that 
               the credit card is valid and has credit available for your intended purchase. In the event Bon Appetit Delivery advances payment for any of your 
               orders placed via the Platform (e.g., if you sign up for a corporate account), Bon Appetit Delivery may separately send you invoices for payment 
               of those advanced amounts. In the event that you fail to pay such invoices within thirty (30) days of the date of such invoice 
               (the “Payment Due Date”), you grant Bon Appetit Delivery the right, but not the obligation, to charge the credit card you provide with your
                Account at any time after any Payment Due Date, unless prohibited by law. Please note, you are unable to complete checkout with 
                only gift card information. In all events, you are required to provide another form of payment to submit an order, even if this
                 payment method is not charged. Also, if you are a campus user and you opt to pay for a purchase with your stored-value card, on
                  certain campuses, (i) Bon Appetit Delivery will charge such purchase to your stored-value card and will charge any applicable fees to either
                   your credit card or other payment on file with us, and (ii) you agree that Bon Appetit Delivery may be unable to refund a purchase to your
                    stored-value card and may, in its discretion, provide a refund through an alternative method.
              </p>
              <p>
              Bon Appetit Delivery reserves the right to establish, remove, and/or revise prices, fees, taxes, and/or surcharges for any or all services 
              or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time, and further reserves the right to consolidate or otherwise 
              incorporate fees and/or surcharges into the prices listed for restaurant food and beverage items. For certain transactions,
               the subtotals shown at checkout are estimates that may be higher or lower than the total amount due. Regardless of the cause,
                Bon Appetit Delivery reserves the right to charge the final price after checkout, including without limitation all applicable transaction
                 taxes. Bon Appetit Delivery may also, in its sole discretion, make Perks or other promotional offers with different features and different 
                 rates available to any or all of our users. Unless made available to you, these Perks and promotional offers will have no bearing
                  on your obligation to pay the amounts charged. For more information on these offers, please see the “Perks” section below.

               of Restaurants. Such Ratings and Reviews are considered Your Content and are governed by the terms and conditions of this

                or partner of Bon Appetit Delivery. Bon Appetit Delivery does not assume liability for Ratings and Reviews or for any claims, liabilities, or losses
                 resulting from any Ratings and Reviews. We strive to maintain a high level of integrity with our Ratings and Reviews and

                      excluded by us without notice.

                order-related messages, and even in such event, you may still receive individual texts from the Restaurant or your delivery person

                We may make available software to access Bon Appetit Delivery’s websites, technology platforms, and related online and mobile
                 services via a mobile device (“Mobile Applications”). To use any Mobile Application, you must use a mobile device

                   additional charges from your wireless provider for these services. You agree that you are solely responsible for any 
                   such charges. Bon Appetit Delivery hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code

                        agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all upgrades to the Mobile Applications. 
                        Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Applications is covered by the applicable open source 
                        or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of
                         the Mobile Applications or any copy thereof, and Bon Appetit Delivery or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right,
                          title, and interest in the Mobile Applications (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the 
                          rights, duties, or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. Bon Appetit Delivery

                            permitted by this Agreement. The Mobile Applications originate in the United States and are subject to United States
                             export laws and regulations. The Mobile Applications may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or

                             Applications may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all

              </p>
              <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
              <h3>PLEASE READ THIS “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” SECTION CAREFULLY. 
                IT LIMITS THE WAYS YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM GRUBHUB AND REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.</h3>
                <h4>I. Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure.</h4>
                <p>
                There might be instances when a dispute arises between you and Bon Appetit Delivery. In those instances, Bon Appetit Delivery is committed to working 
                with you to reach a reasonable resolution; however, we can only do this if we know about and understand each other’s concerns. 
                Therefore, for any issue or dispute that arises between you and Bon Appetit Delivery, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first
                 make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or 
                 otherwise. This includes first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute you initiate,
                  you agree to send the written description of the dispute along with the email address associated with your account to the 
                  following email address: disputeresolution@Bon Appetit Delivery.com. For any dispute that Bon Appetit Delivery initiates, we will send our written
                   description of the dispute to the email address associated with your account. The written description must be on an individual
                    basis and provide at least the following information: your name; the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the relief sought.
                </p>
                <p>
                You and Bon Appetit Delivery then agree to negotiate in good faith about the dispute through an informal telephonic dispute resolution 
                conference between you and Bon Appetit Delivery. The informal telephonic dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized such 
                that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple 
                individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal telephonic dispute resolution conference. If
                 either party is represented by counsel, that party's counsel may participate in the informal telephonic dispute 
                 resolution conference, but the party also must appear at and participate in the conference. This should lead to 
                 resolution, but if for some reason the dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt 
                 of the written description of the dispute, you and Bon Appetit Delivery agree to the further dispute resolution provisions below.
                </p>
                <p>
                To reiterate, this informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to
                 commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. The parties agree that any relevant limitations
                  period and filing fee or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

                <h4>II. Mutual Arbitration Agreement.You and Bon Appetit Delivery agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that
                   may arise out of the interpretation or performance of this Agreement or payments by or to Bon Appetit Delivery, or that
                    in any way relate to your use of the Platform, the Materials, the Services, and/or other content on the Platform, 
                    your relationship with Bon Appetit Delivery, or any other dispute with Bon Appetit Delivery, shall be submitted exclusively to binding arbitration.
                     This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior 
                     Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement.</h4>
                     <p>
                     Notwithstanding the foregoing, issues related to the scope, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration 
                     Agreement are for a court to decide. Also, each party retains the right to (1) elect to have any claims heard
                      in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction 
                      and (2) seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or 
                      threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents,
                       or other confidential or proprietary information or intellectual property rights. For clarity, this “Dispute Resolution”
                        provision does not alter, amend, or affect any of the rights or obligations of the parties to any Bon Appetit Delivery Delivery 
                        Partner Agreement.

                     ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM. RIGHTS TO PREHEARING EXCHANGE
                      OF INFORMATION AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND Bon Appetit Delivery
                       ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
                     </p>
                     <h4>III. Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver.</h4>
                     <p>
                     YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION VII BELOW,
                      THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR CONSOLIDATED
                       BASIS OR IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS CLAIMS AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
                        GENERAL OR FOR PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF). UNLESS BOTH YOU AND Bon Appetit Delivery OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY
                         NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS (EXCEPT AS SET OUT IN SECTION VII BELOW), AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE
                          OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS, JOINT, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF
                           (INCLUDING ANY DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY 
                           TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY’S CLAIM. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT AWARD RELIEF FOR OR AGAINST
                            ANYONE WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     This Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver is an essential part of this “Dispute Resolution” section, 
                     and if it is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor
                      Bon Appetit Delivery is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court 
                      determines that the Class Action and Collective Relief Waiver is not enforceable as to a particular claim 
                      or request for relief and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final),
                       then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be severed 
                       and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.
                     </p>
                     <h4>IV. Arbitration Rules.</h4>
                     <p>
                     The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
                      If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. 
                      Except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” provision, the AAA will administer the arbitration
                       in accordance with either (A) the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect, or (B) the Consumer
                        Arbitration Rules then in effect if the matter involves a “consumer” agreement as defined by Consumer
                         Arbitration Rule R-1 (together, the "Applicable AAA Rules"). The Applicable AAA Rules are available
                          at https://www.adr.org/Rules or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
                     </p>
                     <h4>V. Arbitration Process.</h4>
                     <p>
                     If after sixty (60) days the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure above is unsuccessful in resolving the parties’ dispute,
                      a party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as 
                      specified in the Applicable AAA Rules. (The AAA provides applicable forms for Demands for Arbitration available at
                       <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand_for_Arbitration_0.pdf"> https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Demand_for_Arbitration_0.pdf</a> (Commercial Arbitration Rules) and
                        <a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf"> https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_1.pdf</a> (Consumer Arbitration Rules),
                         and a separate affidavit for waiver of fees for California residents only is
                          available at <a href="https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Waiver_of_Fees_CA_Only.pdf">
                          https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Waiver_of_Fees_CA_Only.pdf</a>.) The arbitrator
                           will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state or county in 
                           which you reside. The parties will first attempt to agree on an arbitrator. If the parties are unable
                            to agree upon an arbitrator within twenty-one (21) days of receiving the AAA’s list of eligible neutrals,
                             then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
                     </p>
                     <h4>VI. Arbitration Location and Procedure.</h4>
                     <p>
                     Unless you and Bon Appetit Delivery otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
                      If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief,
                       then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Bon Appetit Delivery submit to the arbitrator,
                        unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks 
                        declaratory or injunctive relief, your right to a hearing will be determined by the Applicable AAA Rules. Subject
                         to the Applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information
                          by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all
                           arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Bon Appetit Delivery,
                            and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of
                             the arbitration award.
                     </p>
                     <h4>VII. Batch Arbitration.</h4>
                     <p>
                     To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar
                      arbitration demands presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm or organization
                       are submitted to AAA or another arbitration provider (if AAA is unavailable) against Grubhub within a 30-day period
                        (or in otherwise close proximity), the arbitration provider shall (i) administer the arbitration demands in batches
                         of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching
                          described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) designate one arbitrator for each batch;
                           and (iii) provide for a single filing fee due per side per batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Bon Appetit Delivery 
                           and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient
                            resolution of claims, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of claims. This 
                            “Batch Arbitrations” provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Bon Appetit Delivery 
                            does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint
                             or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this section VII.
                     </p>
                     <h4>VIII. Arbitrator's Decision.</h4>
                     <p>
                     The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable AAA Rules.
                      The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator
                       based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
                        The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an
                         individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under
                          applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement. The arbitrator's award of damages and/or other
                           relief must be consistent with section III above and also must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation 
                           of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be
                            held liable.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if
                      authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration. If
                       the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand
                        for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards
                         set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), Bon Appetit Delivery will have the right to recover attorneys’ fees and expenses.
                     </p>
                     <h4>IX. Fees.</h4>
                     <p>
                     Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative, and/or arbitrator fees will be solely as set
                      forth in the applicable AAA Rules (as modified by section VII above). If, however, you are able to
                       demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation,
                        Bon Appetit Delivery will pay as much of the filing, administration, and/or arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary
                         to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive to you.
                     </p>
                     <h4>X. Right to Opt-Out of Arbitration.</h4>
                     <p>Bon Appetit Delivery's updates to these Terms and Conditions do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the 
                     Mutual Arbitration Agreement if you previously agreed to an Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration.
                      Bon Appetit Delivery will continue to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of the Arbitration Agreement in a prior version
                       of the Terms and Conditions. If you create a Bon Appetit Delivery account for the first time on or after December 14, 2020, you
                        may opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Agreement. To opt out, you must notify Bon Appetit Delivery in writing no later than 30
                         days after first becoming subject to this Mutual Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address,
                          the email address you currently use to access your Bon Appetit Delivery account (if you have one), and a clear statement that
                           you want to opt out of this Mutual Arbitration Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice
                            to: disputeresolution@Bon Appetit Delivery.com. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of 
                            this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect
                             on any other arbitration agreements that you may have entered into with Grubhub or may enter into in 
                             the future with Bon Appetit Delivery.</p>
                    <h4>XI. Changes.</h4>
                    <p>
                    Bon Appetit Delivery reserves the right to change this "Dispute Resolution" section, but any such changes will not apply to any
                     individual claim(s) for which you have already provided notice to Bon Appetit Delivery. If Bon Appetit Delivery changes this "Dispute Resolution"
                      section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you
                       agree that your continued use of the Platform or Services after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.
                        If you do not agree to such change, you may reject any such change by providing Bon Appetit Delivery written notice of such rejection 
                        by mail or hand delivery to: Bon Appetit Delivery. In order to
                           be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this
                            "Dispute Resolution" section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between
                             you and Bon Appetit Delivery in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first
                              accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement, as applicable).
                    </p>
